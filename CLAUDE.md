# FineType

FineType is a type inference engine that detects and classifies data types in tabular datasets. It's the core analytical engine of the Meridian project.

## The Meridian Pillars

Every decision in this repo should reflect these principles:

1. **Spark joy for analysts** — Type inference should feel magical, not tedious. Clear output, helpful error messages, sensible defaults.
2. **Write programs that do one thing and do it well** — Each command has one job: `profile` discovers, `taxonomy` generates schema, `validate` enforces and materialises typed output. Separate concerns for separate tools.
3. **Design for the future, for it will be here sooner than you think** — The type taxonomy, model architecture, and extension interfaces should accommodate new data types and formats without breaking existing behaviour.

### Precision Principle

Precision is what makes FineType valuable. Every validation pattern, locale rule, and disambiguation heuristic must meaningfully distinguish "is this type" from "is not this type."

- Prefer precise locale-specific validation over permissive universal patterns. If a type is `designation: locale_specific`, its real validation lives in `validation_by_locale`, not the universal `validation` block.
- A validation that confirms 90% of random input is not a validation.
- Expanding locale coverage is the path to accuracy, not relaxing heuristics.

## Architectural direction (settled — do not re-ask)

- **Multi-branch implements the Sense stage** (decision 0041): The Sense→Sharpen pipeline has two stages — Sense (broad classification) and Sharpen (rule-based post-processing). The Sense stage is currently implemented by the multi-branch model; historically it was implemented by the original Sense model. Both remain in code; multi-branch is the v0.6.19 default.
- **Regex header hints deprecated** (decision 0042): Hardcoded regex `header_hint()` rules are deprecated in favour of learned approaches — multi-branch header branch (Model2Vec), sibling-context attention, semantic matching.
- **Value-based rules only** (decision 0048): New disambiguation rules check actual column values, not header metadata.
- **Strength through simplification** (decision 0038): Prefer retraining over adding disambiguation rules. Rules are a last resort.

## Project state

**Version:** 0.6.19
**Taxonomy:** 240 definitions across 7 domains (container 11, datetime 84, finance 28, geography 25, identity 33, representation 33, technology 26) — all generators pass, 100% alignment.
**Default Sense-stage model:** Multi-branch (sherlock-v19-relu-s42) inside the Sense→Sharpen pipeline. 5-branch: char+embed+stats+header+validation, ReLU+BatchNorm, val_acc 0.9173. Single forward pass per column. Profile eval **369/448 (82.4% label)** on 36 datasets. Original Sense implementation remains in code as an alternative.
**Codebase:** ~20k lines of Rust across 9 crates. Zero Python dependencies (build + runtime).
**Distribution:** GitHub releases (Linux x86/arm, macOS x86/arm, Windows), Homebrew tap, crates.io (core + model), DuckDB community extension (v0.2.0 merged), MCP server.

## Current sprint

**m-19 IN FLIGHT — eval-corpus expansion (Phase A+B).** Three deliverables: realism standard + pre-screen, coverage floor (240/240 types), train/eval leakage firewall (sources.yaml + row-hash SHA256). v18 retrain block enforced until Phase A+B ships. Spec: `orbit/specs/2026-04-21-eval-expansion/`. Decisions 0055/0056/0057.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
